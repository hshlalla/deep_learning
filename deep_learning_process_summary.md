Roadmap
This roadmap related to Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Engineer and Big Data Engineer. Pick up this roadmap from here
You can take a peek at this doc, too.

You have to learn the maths before ML and DL
One of the most well known platform in the maths: Khan Academy
See John Krohn sessions from here
A nice site for learn the math: maths is fun
Arabic sourse on YouTube from here

Arabic Courses on YouTube
For ML >>> Mustafa Othman and Hesham Asem
For Python >>> Codzilla, Elzero, Python part1 and part2
For SQL >>> MS SQL Server
For Git and GitHub >>> Git&GitHub
For Docker and Kubernetes >>> Docker

For anyone working in technology who wants to travel and work in large companies


Manara >>> This simply allows you to join a large tech company. You apply, enter the learning path, have technical and behavioral mock interviews, and then access the career platform.

SquadIO >>> This is a company that hires people for companies, most of which are in the Gulf, most of the work is remote and payment is in dollars. You apply to them and pass a code test, then a technical interview, and then you enter their pool until they find a company that requires someone with your technical skills, and they connect you with each other and you enter the interview.

Imagine >>> This is a company that hires people for companies in Europe in general and Germany in particular, and they can help with the process with any company even if it is not through them. Their work is remote, relocate, or onsite. You fill out your information and there is an exam.
